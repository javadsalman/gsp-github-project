# Lesson Project: Git and GitHub

## Introduction
This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Git and GitHub, two essential tools for version control and collaboration in software development. 

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It tracks changes in source code during software development.

### Key Git Commands
- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository>`: Creates a copy of an existing repository.
- `git add <file>`: Stages changes for the next commit.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Uploads local commits to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
- `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switches to a specified branch.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and collaboration. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories and offers additional features like issue tracking, project management, and team collaboration.

### GitHub Roles
- **Owner**: Has full control over the repository, including managing settings and permissions.
- **Collaborator**: Can contribute to the repository, make changes, and push updates.
- **Viewer**: Can view the repository and its contents but cannot make changes.

## Conclusion
Understanding Git and GitHub is crucial for modern software development. This lesson project will equip you with the necessary skills to effectively use these tools in your projects.
